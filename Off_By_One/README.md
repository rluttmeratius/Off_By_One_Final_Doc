Auditory learning

## What is an Audeme?

Pronounced "awe deems," they are brief audio illustrations that combine sound effects, sometimes with music, to form aural symbols that signify various ideas, things, actions and situations. For example, an Audeme combining the sound of a cat's meow and a person snoring could mean "Cat Nap". 

Since 2007 Professor Mannheimer of Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis has worked with blind and visually impaired students and their teachers to develop audemes and audeme games. The results have been very encouraging. Students who hear audemes presented with educational materials score significantly better in tests of those materials than students who did not hear the audemes. And when students play audeme riddle games based on chapters from standard science textbooks, they score significantly better in end-of-chapter tests than in tests for chapters learned without audeme games. After a year of audeme game play, students expressed significantly more positive subjective attitudes about science and science learning. These results have helped Professor Mannheimer's work generate grant funding from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust, Google Research Awards and the National Science Foundation. In 2016, Professor Mannheimer partnered with the American Printing House for the Blind and students from Indiana University Southeast to continue work on the project.
