The .csv files contain all of the 
table row data, and the .sql scripts 
will create new tables on your 
system when you run them with the 
mysql source command.  These are both
 found in the source folder. Included 
in this folder is the mysql database
 audeme, including separate tables
 for the game and dictionary.
